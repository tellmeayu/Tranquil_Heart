# Tranquil Heart
An interactive mindfulness app that enables users to create calming soundscapes through touch and gesture controls. Built with Swift for iOS/iPadOS.

## Overview
Tranquil Heart provides an active approach to meditation through three interactive mini-games where users manipulate audio and haptic feedback in real-time. Rather than passive listening, users engage directly with sound to achieve focus and relaxation.

## Features
- **Touch for Music**: Tap-based harmonic tone generation
- **Harmony with Me**: Swipe-controlled tremolo effects
- **Feel Your Vibe**: Haptic feedback synchronized with gestures
- Minimalist UI design
- Real-time audio synthesis and manipulation
